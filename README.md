🚀 Overview
-----------------
Octtopus is an AI-powered desktop meeting assistant that automatically detects online meetings and generates:

📝 Meeting Transcripts
📄 AI Summaries

It runs silently in the background and activates when you open meeting platforms like:

Google Meet
Microsoft Teams
Zoom

Octtopus is built using Python, local device drivers, and lightweight ML models, and is now released as open source for everyone to use and improve.

💡 The Idea
-----------------
Octtopus was built from a simple thought:
"What if my PC could automatically understand and summarize my meetings without relying on cloud services?"
Even though the market already has many tools, Octtopus focuses on:

🖥 Fully local execution (All processing and execution is done locally with minimum resource utilization)
🔐 No cloud dependency.
💰 Free & open source
🎯 Lightweight ML models

🔐 Privacy First – 100% Local Processing
---------------------------------------------
Octtopus is designed with one core principle:
Your meetings should stay yours.

✅ No cloud uploads
✅ No external servers
✅ No third-party data sharing
✅ No hidden analytics

All processing — audio capture, transcription, summarization — happens locally on your device.
Your meeting data never leaves your PC.
This makes Octtopus ideal for:
Confidential business meetings
Academic discussions
Private strategy calls
Sensitive internal conversations

⭐ Why Open Source?
------------------------

While building Octtopus, I realized the market already has many strong players.
Instead of competing commercially, I decided to:
Make it free
Make it open
Let the community build together
Because innovation grows faster when shared.
